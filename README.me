For the imageURL of the pictures database, I am inputting shortened (goo.gl) link of the image link itself.

This way I can easily add imageURLs by passing the URLs in with the HTTP GET request URL.

If you want to test this, find an image online, get the URL shorten the URL, and just input the id part of the URL.
